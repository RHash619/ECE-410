# ECE-410
algorithms for processing audio signals such as equalization and time stretching, estimating acoustic signal metrics such as loudness and sharpness, and extracting audio features such as MFCC and pitch. It also provides advanced machine learning models, including i-vectors, and pretrained deep learning networks, including VGGish and CREPE. Toolbox apps support live algorithm testing, impulse response measurement, and signal labeling. The toolbox provides streaming interfaces to ASIO, CoreAudio, and other sound cards; MIDI devices; and tools for generating and hosting VST and Audio Units plugins.
